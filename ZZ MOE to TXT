Introduction

Science is a required area of study in Saskatchewan’s Core
Curriculum. The purpose of this curriculum is to outline the
provincial requirements for Chemistry 30.

This curriculum provides the intended learning outcomes that
Chemistry 30 students are expected to achieve in science by the end
of the course. Indicators are included to provide the breadth and
depth of what students should know and be able to do in order to
achieve the learning outcomes.

This renewed curriculum reflects current science education            Inquiry into authentic student
research and updated technology and is responsive to changing         questions generated from
demographics within the province. This curriculum is based on         student experiences is the central
the Pan-Canadian Protocol for Collaboration on School                 strategy for teaching science.

This curriculum includes the following information to support
science instruction in Saskatchewan schools:
    • connections to Core Curriculum, including the Broad
        Areas of Learning and Cross-curricular Competencies;
    • the K-12 aim and goals for science education;
    • characteristics of an effective science program;
    • Chemistry 30 outcomes and indicators;
    • sample assessment and evaluation criteria related to
        outcomes in science; and
    • a glossary.

                                Using this Curriculum
    Outcomes describe the                Outcomes are statements of what students are expected to know and
    knowledge, skills and                be able to do by the end of a grade or secondary level course in a

    expected to attain by the end of a   outcomes provide direction for assessment and evaluation, and for
    particular course.                   program, unit and lesson planning.
                                         Critical characteristics of an outcome include the following:
                                           • focus on what students will learn rather than what teachers will
                                                teach;
                                           • specify the skills and abilities, understandings, knowledge
                                                and/or attitudes students are expected to demonstrate;
                                           • are observable, assessable and attainable;
                                           • are written using action-based verbs and clear professional
                                                language (educational and subject-related);
                                           • are developed to be achieved in context so that learning is
                                                purposeful and interconnected;
                                           • are grade and subject specific;
                                           • are supported by indicators which provide the breadth and
                                                depth of expectations; and,
                                           • have a developmental flow and connection to other grades
                                                where applicable.

    Indicators are a representative      Indicators are representative of what students need to know and/or
    list of what students should know    be able to do in order to achieve an outcome. When teachers are
    or be able to do if they have        planning for instruction, they must comprehend the set of indicators to
    attained the outcome.                understand fully the breadth and the depth of learning related to a
                                         particular outcome. Based on this understanding of the outcome,
                                         teachers may develop their own indicators that are responsive of
                                         students’ interests, lives and prior learning. These teacher-developed
                                         indicators must maintain the intent of the outcome.
                                         Within the outcomes and indicators in this curriculum the terms
                                         “including”, “such as” and “e.g.,” commonly occur. Each term serves a
                                         specific purpose:
                                            • The term “including” prescribes content, contexts or strategies
                                                that students must experience in their learning, without
                                                excluding other possibilities. For example, an indicator might
                                                say that students should discuss the historical development and
                                                limitations of theories, including Arrhenius, Brønsted -Lowry
                                                and Lewis, which explain the behaviour of acids and bases. This
                                                means that it is mandatory to discuss those three particular
                                                theories, but others may also be discussed.
                                            • The term “such as” provides examples of possible broad
                                                categories of content, contexts or strategies that teachers or
                                                students may choose, without excluding other possibilities. For
                                                example, an indicator might include the phrase “such as
                                                powering a small electric device” as an example of student-
                                                identified criteria related to the design, construction and evaluation of
                                                a prototype of a working battery.

      •    Finally, the term “e.g.,” offers specific examples of what a
           term, concept or strategy might look like. For example, an
           indicator might include the phrase “e.g., graphene,
           aerogels, polymers and carbon nanotubes” as examples
           of modern materials that could change the way we live.

Grades 10-12 Science Framework
 Saskatchewan’s grades 10 to 12 science courses incorporate core
 ideas from the Pan-Canadian Protocol for Collaboration on
 School Curriculum Common Framework of Science Learning
 Outcomes K to 12 (CMEC, 1997). Saskatchewan has developed
 science courses at Grade 11 that provide students with
 opportunities to learn core biology, chemistry and physics
 disciplinary ideas within interdisciplinary contexts. Students
 should select courses based on their interests and what they
 believe will best fit their needs after high school.

 The chart below visually illustrates the courses in each pathway
 and their relationship to each other.




Each course in each pathway is to be taught and learned to the
same level of rigour. No pathway or course is considered “easy
science”; rather, all pathways and courses present “different
sciences” for different purposes.

Students may take courses from more than one pathway for
credit. The current credit requirements for graduation from Grade
12 are one 10-level credit and one 20-level credit in science.

                                        Core Curriculum
                                        Core Curriculum is intended to provide all Saskatchewan students
                                        with an education that will serve them well regardless of their
                                        choices after leaving school. Through its various components and
                                        initiatives, Core Curriculum supports the achievement of the Goals of
                                        Education for Saskatchewan. For current information regarding Core
                                        Curriculum, please refer to the Registrar’s Handbook for School
                                        Administrators found on the Government of Saskatchewan website.

                                        connect the specificity of the areas of study and the day-to-day work
                                        of teachers with the broader philosophy of Core Curriculum and the
                                        Goals of Education for Saskatchewan.

                                        Broad Areas of Learning
                                        There are three Broad Areas of Learning that reflect Saskatchewan’s
                                        Goals of Education. Science education contributes to student
                                        achievement of the Goals of Education through helping students
                                        achieve knowledge, skills and attitudes related to these Broad Areas
                                        of Learning.

                                        Lifelong Learners
    Related to the following Goals of   Students who are engaged in constructing and applying science

Cross-curricular Competencies
The Cross-curricular Competencies are four interrelated areas
containing understandings, values, skills and processes which are
considered important for learning in all areas of study. These
competencies reflect the Common Essential Learnings and are
intended to be addressed in each area of study at each grade.

Developing Thinking
Learners construct knowledge to make sense of the world                 K-12 Goals for Developing
around them. In science, students develop understanding by              Thinking:
building and reflecting on their observations and what is already       • thinking and learning

                                       Aim and Goals
                                       The aim of K-12 science education is to enable all Saskatchewan
                                       students to develop scientific literacy. Scientific literacy today
                                       embraces Euro-Canadian and Indigenous heritages, both of which
                                       have developed an empirical and rational knowledge of nature. A

                                       knowledge.
                                       Diverse learning experiences based on the outcomes in this
                                       curriculum provide students with many opportunities to explore,
                                       analyze, evaluate, synthesize, appreciate and understand the
                                       interrelationships among science, technology, society and the
                                       environment (STSE) that will affect their personal lives, their careers
                                       and their future.
                                       Goals are broad statements identifying what students are expected
                                       to know and be able to do upon completion of the learning in a

 Inquiry builds on students’ inherent sense of curiosity and wonder,
 drawing on their diverse backgrounds, interests and experiences.
 The process provides opportunities for students to become active
 participants in a collaborative search for meaning and
 understanding.


 Secondary students who are engaged in inquiry in science should be able to:
    • identify questions and concepts that guide scientific investigations.
    • design and conduct scientific investigations.
    • use technology and mathematics to improve investigations and communications.
    • formulate and revise scientific explanations and models using logic and evidence.
    • recognize and analyze alternative explanations and models.
    • communicate and defend a scientific argument.
                                                                             (NRC, 1996, pp. 175, 176)

Creating Questions for Inquiry in Science
 Inquiry focuses on the development of questions to initiate and
 guide the learning process. Students and teachers formulate
 questions to motivate inquiries into topics, problems and issues
 related to curriculum content and outcomes.                             Good science inquiry provides
                                                                         many entry points – ways in

 learning and develop new questions for further inquiry.                 (Kluger-Bell, 2000, p.48)
 In science, teachers and students can use the four learning
 contexts of Scientific Inquiry, Technological Problem Solving, STSE
 Decision Making, and Cultural Perspectives (see Learning Contexts
 section of this document for further information) as curriculum
 entry points to begin their inquiry. The process may evolve into
 interdisciplinary learning opportunities reflective of the holistic
 nature of our lives and an interdependent global environment.

 Developing questions evoked by student interests has the
 potential for rich and deep learning. These questions are used
 to initiate and guide the inquiry and give students direction for
                                                                         Essential questions that lead to

       Science Challenges
     Science challenges, which may include science festivals, science fairs,
     science leagues, science Olympics, science Olympiads or talent
     searches, are instructional methods suitable for students to undertake
     to achieve curricular outcomes. Teachers may incorporate science
     challenge activities as an integral component of the science program
     or treat them similar to other extracurricular activities such as school
     sports and clubs. Teachers undertaking science challenges as a
     classroom activity should consider these guidelines, adapted from the
     National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) position statement
     Science Competitions (1999):
          • Student and staff participation should be voluntary and open
               to all students.
          • Emphasis should be placed on the learning experience rather
               than the competition.
          • Science competitions should supplement and enhance other
               learning and support student achievement of curriculum
               outcomes.
          • Projects and presentations should be the work of the student,
               with proper credit given to others for their contributions.
          • Science competitions should foster partnerships among
               students, the school and the science community.
     Science challenge activities may be conducted solely at the school
     level, or with the intent of preparing students for competition in one
     of the regional science fairs, perhaps as a step towards the Canada-
     Wide Science Festival. Although students may be motivated by prizes,
     awards and the possibility of scholarships, teachers should emphasize
     that the importance of doing a science fair project includes attaining
     new experiences and skills that go beyond science, technology or
     engineering. Students learn to present their ideas to an authentic
     public that may consist of parents, teachers and the top scientists in a
     given field.
     Science fair projects typically consist of:
         • an experiment, which is an original scientific experiment with
            a specific, original hypothesis. Students should control all
            important variables and demonstrate appropriate data
            collection and analysis techniques;
         • a study, which involves the collection of data to reveal a
            pattern or correlation. Studies can include cause and effect
            relationships and theoretical investigations of the data.
            Studies are often carried out using surveys given to human
            subjects; or,
         • an innovation, which deals with the creation and
            development of a new device, model, or technique in a
            technological field. These innovations may have commercial
            applications or be of benefit to humans.

     fairs and festivals in Canada.

An Effective Science Education Program

An effective science education program supports student
achievement of learning outcomes through:
    •    incorporating all foundations of scientific literacy;
    •    using the learning contexts as entry points into student
         inquiry;
    •    understanding and effectively using the language of
         science;
    •    engaging in laboratory and field work;
    •    practicing safety; and
    •    choosing and using technology in science appropriately.

All science outcomes and indicators emphasize one or more
foundations of scientific literacy; these represent the “what” of the
curriculum. The learning contexts represent different processes for
engaging students in achieving curricular outcomes; they are the
“how” of the curriculum.
Scientists construct models to support their explanations based
on empirical evidence. Students need to engage in similar
processes through authentic laboratory work. During their
investigations, students must follow safe practices in the
laboratory, as well as in regard to living things.
Technology serves to extend our powers of observation and to
support the sharing of information. Students should use a variety
of technology tools for data collection and analysis, for
visualization and imaging and for communication and
collaboration throughout the science curriculum.
To achieve the vision of scientific literacy outlined in this
curriculum, students must increasingly become engaged in the
planning, development and evaluation of their own learning
activities. In the process, students should have the opportunity to
work collaboratively with others, to initiate investigations, to
communicate findings and to complete projects that demonstrate
learning.

•    All science outcomes and indicators emphasize one or more of the foundations of scientific
     literacy (STSE, Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes); these represent the “what” of the curriculum.
     All outcomes are mandatory.
•    The four learning contexts (Scientific Inquiry, Technological Problem Solving, Cultural
     Perspectives and STSE Decision Making) represent different processes for engaging students
     in achieving curricular outcomes; they represent the “how” of the curriculum.

Foundations of Scientific Literacy
The K-12 goals of science education parallel the foundation statements for scientific literacy
described in the Common Framework of Science Learning Outcomes K to 12 (CMEC, 1997). These
four foundation statements delineate the critical aspects of students’ scientific literacy. They
reflect the wholeness and interconnectedness of learning and should be considered interrelated
and mutually supportive.

Foundation 1: Science, Technology, Society and the Environment (STSE)
Interrelationships
This foundation is concerned with understanding the scope and character of science, its
connections to technology and the social and environmental contexts in which it is developed.
This foundation is the driving force of scientific literacy. Three major dimensions address this
foundation.

Nature of Science and Technology
Science is a social and cultural activity anchored in a particular intellectual tradition. It is one way
of knowing nature, based on curiosity, imagination, intuition, exploration, observation, replication,
interpretation of evidence and consensus making over this evidence and its interpretation. More
than most other ways of knowing nature, science excels at predicting what will happen next,
based on its descriptions and explanations of natural and technological phenomena.

Science-based ideas are continually being tested, modified and improved as new ideas supersede
existing ones. Technology, like science, is a creative human activity, but is concerned with solving
practical problems that arise from human/social needs, particularly the need to adapt to the
environment and to fuel a nation’s economy. New products and processes are produced by
research and development through inquiry and design.

Relationships between Science and Technology
Historically, the development of technology has been strongly linked to the development of
science, with each making contributions to the other. While there are important relationships and
interdependencies, there are also important differences. Where the focus of science is on the
development and verification of knowledge, in technology, the focus is on the development of
solutions, involving devices and systems that meet a given need within the constraints of the
problem. The test of science knowledge is that it helps us explain, interpret and predict; the test of
technology is that it works – it enables us to achieve a given purpose.

Social and Environmental Contexts of Science and Technology

The history of science shows that scientific development takes place within a social context that
includes economic, political, social and cultural forces along with personal biases and the need for
peer acceptance and recognition. Many examples show that cultural and intellectual traditions
have influenced the focus and methodologies of science, and that science, in turn, has influenced
the wider world of ideas. Today, societal and environmental needs and issues often drive research
agendas. As technological solutions have emerged from previous research, many of the new
technologies have given rise to complex social and environmental issues which are increasingly
becoming part of the political agenda. The potential of science, technology and Indigenous
knowledge to inform and empower decision making by individuals, communities and society is
central to scientific literacy in a democratic society.

Foundation 2: Scientific Knowledge
This foundation focuses on the subject matter of science including the theories, models, concepts and
principles that are essential to an understanding of the natural and constructed world. For organizational
purposes, this foundation is framed using widely accepted science disciplines.

Life science deals with the growth and interactions of life forms within their environments in ways that
reflect the uniqueness, diversity, genetic continuity and changing nature of these life forms. Life science
includes the study of topics such as ecosystems, biological diversity, organisms, cell biology, biochemistry,
diseases, genetic engineering and biotechnology.
Physical Science
Physical science, which encompasses chemistry and physics, deals with matter, energy and forces. Matter
has structure, and its components interact. Energy links matter to gravitational, electromagnetic and
nuclear forces in the universe. The conservation laws of mass and energy, momentum and charge are
addressed in physical science.
Earth and Space Science
Earth and space science brings local, global and universal perspectives to student knowledge. Earth, our
home planet, exhibits form, structure and patterns of change, as do our surrounding solar system and the
physical universe beyond. Earth and space science includes such fields of study as geology, hydrology,
meteorology and astronomy.


 Sources of Knowledge about Nature
 A strong science program recognizes that modern science is not the only form of empirical knowledge
 about nature and aims to broaden student understanding of traditional and local knowledge systems.
 The dialogue between scientists and traditional knowledge holders has an extensive history and
 continues to grow as researchers and practitioners seek to better understand our complex world. The
 terms “traditional knowledge”, “Indigenous knowledge” and “Traditional Ecological Knowledge” are
 used by practitioners worldwide when referencing local knowledge systems which are embedded
 within particular worldviews. This curriculum uses the term “Indigenous knowledge” and provides the
 following definitions to show parallels and distinctions between Indigenous knowledge and scientific
 knowledge.

Fundamental Concepts – Linking Scientific Disciplines
A useful way to create linkages among science disciplines is through fundamental concepts that
underlie and integrate different scientific disciplines. Fundamental concepts provide a context
for explaining, organizing and connecting knowledge. Students deepen their understanding of
these fundamental concepts and apply their understanding with increasing sophistication as
they progress through the curriculum from Kindergarten to Grade 12. These fundamental
concepts are identified in the following chart.

 Constancy and               The ideas of constancy and change underlie understanding of the natural
 Change                      and constructed world. Through observations, students learn that some
                             characteristics of materials and systems remain constant over time
                             whereas other characteristics change. These changes vary in rate, scale
                             and pattern, including trends and cycles, and may be quantified using
                             mathematics, particularly measurement.
 Matter and                  Objects in the physical world are comprised of matter. Students examine
 Energy                      materials to understand their properties and structures. The idea of
                             energy provides a conceptual tool that brings together many
                             understandings about natural phenomena, materials and the process of
                             change. Energy, whether transmitted or transformed, is the driving force
                             of both movement and change.
 Similarity and              The ideas of similarity and diversity provide tools for organizing our
 Diversity                   experiences with the natural and constructed world. Beginning with
                             informal experiences, students learn to recognize attributes of materials
                             that help to make useful distinctions between one type of material and
                             another, and between one event and another. Over time, students
                             adopt accepted procedures and protocols for describing and classifying
                             objects encountered, thus enabling students to share ideas with others
                             and to reflect on their own experiences.
 Systems and                 An important way to understand and interpret the world is to think about
 Interactions                the whole in terms of its parts and alternately about its parts in terms of
                             how they relate to one another and to the whole. A system is an
                             organized group of related objects or components that interact with one
                             another so that the overall effect is much greater than that of the
                             individual parts, even when these are considered together.
 Sustainability and          Sustainability refers to the ability to meet our present needs without
 Stewardship                 compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
                             Stewardship refers to the personal responsibility to take action in
                             order to participate in the responsible management of natural
                             resources. By developing their understanding of ideas related to
                             sustainability, students are able to take increasing responsibility for
                             making choices that reflect those ideas.

Foundation 3: Scientific and Technological Skills and Processes
This foundation identifies the skills and processes students develop in answering questions, solving
problems and making decisions. While these skills and processes are not unique to science, they play an
important role in the development of scientific and technological understanding and in the application of
acquired knowledge to new situations. Four broad skill areas are outlined in this foundation. Each area is
developed further at each grade level with increasing scope and complexity of application.
Initiating and Planning
These are the processes of questioning, identifying problems and developing preliminary ideas and plans.
Performing and Recording
These are the skills and processes of carrying out a plan of action, which involves gathering evidence by
observation and, in most cases, manipulating materials and equipment. Gathered evidence can be
documented and recorded in a variety of formats.
Analyzing and Interpreting
These are the skills and processes of examining information and evidence, organizing and presenting data
so that they can be interpreted, interpreting those data, evaluating the evidence and applying the results
of that evaluation.
Communication and Teamwork
In science and technology, as in other areas, communication skills are essential whenever ideas are being
developed, tested, interpreted, debated and accepted or rejected. Teamwork skills are also important
because the development and application of ideas rely on collaborative processes both in science-related
occupations and in learning.

Foundation 4: Attitudes
This foundation focuses on encouraging students to develop attitudes, values and ethics that inform a
responsible use of science and technology for the mutual benefit of self, society and the environment. This
foundation identifies six categories in which science education can contribute to the development of
scientific literacy.
Both scientific and Indigenous knowledge systems place value on attitudes, values and ethics. These are
more likely to be presented in a holistic manner in Indigenous knowledge systems.
Appreciation of Science
Students will be encouraged to critically and contextually appreciate the role and contributions of science
and technology in their lives and to their community’s culture; and to be aware of the limits of science and
technology as well as their impact on economic, political, environmental, cultural and ethical events.
Interest in Science
Students will be encouraged to develop curiosity and continuing interest in the study of science at home,
in school and in the community.
Inquiry in Science
Students will be encouraged to develop critical beliefs concerning the need for evidence and reasoned
argument in the development of scientific knowledge.

Collaboration
Students will be encouraged to nurture competence in collaborative activity with classmates
and others, inside and outside of the school.
Stewardship
Students will be encouraged to develop responsibility in the application of science and
technology in relation to society and the natural environment.
Safety
Students engaged in science and technology activities will be expected to demonstrate a concern
for safety and doing no harm to themselves or others, including plants and animals.

Learning Contexts
Learning contexts provide entry points into the curriculum that        Each learning context is

         and that facilitate prediction.
     • The technological problem solving learning context
         reflects an emphasis on designing and building to solve
         practical human problems similar to the way an engineer
         would.
     • The STSE decision making learning context reflects the
         need to engage citizens in thinking about human and
         world issues through a scientific lens in order to inform
         and empower decision making by individuals,
         communities and society.
     • The cultural perspectives learning context reflects a
         humanistic perspective that views teaching and learning
         as cultural transmission and acquisition (Aikenhead, 2006).
These learning contexts are not mutually exclusive; thus, well-
designed instruction may incorporate more than one learning
context. Students should experience learning through each
learning context at each grade; it is not necessary, nor advisable,
for each student to attempt to engage in learning through each
learning context in each unit of study. Learning within a
classroom may be structured to enable individuals or groups of
students to achieve the same curricular outcomes through
different learning contexts.
A choice of learning approaches can also be informed by recent
well-established ideas on how and why students learn:
    • Learning occurs when students are treated as a
        community of practitioners of scientific literacy.
    • Learning is both a social and an individual event for

Chemistry 30                                                                                               17
        constructing and refining ideas and competences.
                                        • Learning involves the development of new self-identities for
                                           many students.
                                        • Learning is inhibited when students feel a culture clash

                                                  investigations;
                                             • using tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data;
                                             • proposing critical answers, explanations, and predictions;
                                                  and,

                                         By participating in a variety of inquiry experiences that vary in the
                                         amount of student self-direction, students develop competencies
                                         necessary to conduct inquiries of their own – a key element to
                                         scientific literacy.

     By participating in a variety of technological and environmental
     problem-solving activities, students develop capacities to analyze
     and resolve authentic problems in the natural and constructed
     world.

     STSE Decision Making [DM]
     Scientific knowledge can be related to understanding the             To engage with science and

     Students may engage with STSE issues through research projects,
     student-designed laboratory investigations, case studies, role
     playing, debates, deliberative dialogues and action projects.

     Cultural Perspectives [CP]
     Students should recognize and respect that all cultures develop
     knowledge systems to describe and explain nature. Two

     activities that explicitly explore Indigenous knowledge or
     knowledge from other cultures.

                                     By engaging in explorations of cultural perspectives, scientifically
                                     literate students begin to appreciate the worldviews and belief
                                     systems fundamental to science and to Indigenous knowledge.

                                     The Language of Science
                                     Science is a way of understanding the natural world using internally
                                     consistent methods and principles that are well-described and
                                     understood by the scientific community. The principles and theories
                                     of science have been established through repeated experimentation
                                     and observation and have been refereed through peer review before
                                     general acceptance by the scientific community. Acceptance of a
                                     theory does not imply unchanging belief in a theory, or denote
                                     dogma. Instead, as new data become available, previous scientific
                                     explanations are revised and improved, or rejected and replaced.
                                     There is a progression from a hypothesis to a theory using testable,
                                     scientific laws. Many hypotheses are tested to generate a theory.
                                     Only a few scientific facts are considered laws (e.g., the law of
                                     conservation of mass and Newton’s laws of motion).

                                  Scientists use the terms “law”, “theory” and “hypothesis” to
                                  describe various types of scientific explanations about
                                  phenomena in the natural and constructed world. These
                                  meanings differ from common usage of the same terms:
                                      • Law – A law is a generalized description, usually expressed
                                          in mathematical terms, that describes some aspect of the
                                          natural world under certain conditions.
 The terms “law”, “theory” and        • Theory – A theory is an explanation for a set of related
 “hypothesis” have special                observations or events that may consist of statements,
 meaning in science.                      equations, models or a combination of these. Theories also
                                          predict the results of future observations. An explanation is
                                          verified multiple times by different groups of researchers
                                          before it becomes a theory. The procedures and processes
                                          for testing a theory are well-defined within each scientific
                                          discipline, but they vary between disciplines. No amount of
                                          evidence proves that a theory is correct. Rather, scientists
                                          accept theories
         until the emergence of new evidence that the theory is
         unable to adequately explain. At this point, the theory is

20                                                                                        Chemistry 30
               discarded or modified to explain the new evidence. Note
               that theories never become laws; theories explain laws.

       •       Hypothesis – A hypothesis is a tentative, testable
               generalization that may be used to explain a relatively large
               number of events in the natural world. It is subject to
               immediate or eventual testing by experiments. Hypotheses
               must be worded in such a way that they can be falsified.
               Hypotheses are never proven correct, but are supported by
               empirical evidence.

  Scientific models are constructed to represent and explain certain
  aspects of physical phenomenon. Models are never exact replicas
  of real phenomena; rather, models are simplified versions of reality,
  constructed in order to facilitate study of complex systems such as
  the atom, climate change and biogeochemical cycles. Models may
  be physical, mental, mathematical or contain a combination of
  these elements. Models are complex constructions that consist of
  conceptual objects and processes in which the objects participate
  or interact. Scientists spend considerable time and effort building
  and testing models to further understanding of the natural world.

  When engaging in the processes of science, students are constantly
  building and testing their own models of understanding of the
  natural world. Students may need help in learning how to identify
  and articulate their own models of natural phenomena. Activities
  that involve reflection and metacognition are particularly useful in
  this regard. Students should be able to identify the features of the
  natural phenomena their models represent or explain. Just as
  importantly, students should identify which features are not
  represented or explained by their models. Students should
  determine the usefulness of their model by judging whether the
  model helps in understanding the underlying concepts or
  processes. Ultimately, students realize that different models of the
  same phenomena may be needed in order to investigate or
  understand different aspects of the phenomena.

                                         should be designed so that all students – including students with
                                         academic and physical challenges – are able to authentically
                                         participate in and benefit from those experiences.

Chemistry 30                                                                                                      21
     Laboratory activities help students develop scientific and
     technological skills and processes including:
         • initiating and planning;
         • performing and recording;
         • analyzing and interpreting; and,
         • communication and teamwork.

     Laboratory investigations also help students understand the nature
     of science; specifically that theories and laws must be consistent with
     observations. Similarly, student-centered laboratory investigations
     help to emphasize the need for curiosity and inquisitiveness as part
     of the scientific endeavour. The National Science Teachers
     Association (NSTA) position statement The Integral Role of Laboratory
     Investigations in Science Instruction (2007) provides further
     information about laboratory investigations.

     A strong science program includes a variety of individual, small- and
     large-group laboratory experiences for students. Most importantly,
     the laboratory experience needs to go beyond conducting
     confirmatory “cook-book” experiments. Similarly, computer
     simulations and teacher demonstrations are valuable but should not
     serve as substitutions for hands-on student laboratory activities.

     Assessment and evaluation of student performance must reflect the
     nature of the laboratory experience by addressing scientific and
     technological skills. As such, the results of student investigations and
     experiments do not always need to be presented using formal
     laboratory reports. Teachers may consider alternative formats such as
     narrative lab reports for some investigations. The narrative lab report
     enables students to tell the story of their process and findings by
     addressing four questions:
         • What was I looking for?
         • How did I look for it?
         • What did I find?
         • What do these findings mean?

     Student responses to these questions may be provided orally, in point
     form or through other methods rather than using the structured
     headings of Purpose, Procedure, Hypothesis, Data, Analysis and
     Conclusion typically associated with a formal laboratory report. For
     some investigations, teachers may decide it is sufficient for students
     to explain the significance of their findings.

Safety in the classroom is of paramount importance. Other
components of education (e.g., resources, teaching strategies and       Safety cannot be mandated solely by

appropriately.

Safe practice in the laboratory is the joint responsibility of the
teacher and students. The teacher’s responsibility is to provide a
safe environment and to ensure the students are aware of safe
practice. The students’ responsibility is to act intelligently based
on the advice which is given and which is available in various
resources.
                                                                        The Chemical Hazard Information

Texley, Kwan, and Summers (2004) suggest that teachers, as
professionals, consider four Ps of safety: prepare, plan, prevent and
protect. The following points are adapted from those guidelines
and provide a starting point for thinking about safety in the
science classroom:
    • Prepare
        o Keep up to date with your personal safety knowledge
            and certifications.
        o Be aware of national, provincial, school division and
            school level safety policies and guidelines.
        o Create a safety contract with students.
    • Plan
        o Develop learning plans that ensure all students learn
            effectively and safely.
        o Choose activities that are best suited to the learning
            styles, maturity and behaviour of all students and that
            include all students.
        o Create safety checklists for in-class activities and field
            studies.
    • Prevent
        o Assess and mitigate hazards.
        o Review procedures for accident prevention with
            students.
        o Teach and review safety procedures with students,
            including the need for appropriate clothing.
        o Do not use defective or unsafe equipment or
            procedures.

       o   Do not allow students to eat or drink in science areas.

                                       •   Protect
                                           o Ensure students have sufficient protective devices, such
                                              as safety glasses.
                                           o Demonstrate and instruct students on the proper use of
                                              safety equipment and protective gear.
                                           o Model safe practice by insisting that all students, visitors
                                              and you use appropriate protective devices.

                                   The definition of safety includes consideration of the well-being of all
                                   components of the biosphere, such as plants, animals, earth, air and
                                   water. From knowing what wild flowers can be picked to considering

                                   Safety in the science classroom includes the storage, use and

 based technologies.                                                  (Flick & Bell, 2000)

 Some recommended examples of using computer technologies to
 support teaching and learning in science include:
    • Data Collection and Analysis
       o Data loggers permit students to collect and analyze
            data, often in real-time, and to collect observations
            over very short or long periods of time, enabling
            investigations that otherwise would be impractical.
       o Databases and spreadsheets can facilitate the analysis
            and display of student-collected data or data obtained
            from scientists.
    • Visualization and Imaging
       o Simulation and modeling software provide
            opportunities to explore concepts and models which
            are not readily accessible in the classroom, such as
            those that require expensive or unavailable materials
            or equipment, hazardous materials or procedures,
            levels of skills not yet achieved by the students or
            more time than is possible or appropriate in a
            classroom.
       o Students may collect their own digital images and
            video recordings as part of their data collection and
            analysis or they may access digital images and video
            online to help enhance understanding of scientific
            concepts.
    • Communication and Collaboration
        o The Internet can be a means of networking with
            scientists, teachers, and other students by gathering
            information and data, posting data and findings, and
            comparing results with students in different locations.
        o Students can participate in authentic science projects
            by contributing local data to large-scale web-based
            science inquiry projects such as Journey North or
            GLOBE.

Assessment and Evaluation of Student Learning

Assessment and evaluation require thoughtful planning and implementation to support the learning
process and to inform teaching. All assessment and evaluation of student achievement must be based
on the outcomes in the provincial curriculum.

Assessment involves the systematic collection of information about student learning with respect to:
   • achievement of provincial curriculum outcomes;
   • effectiveness of teaching strategies employed; and,
   • student self-reflection on learning.

Evaluation compares assessment information against criteria based on curriculum outcomes for the
purpose of communicating to students, teachers, parents/caregivers and others about student progress
and to make informed decisions about the teaching and learning process.

There are three interrelated purposes of assessment. Each type of assessment, systematically
implemented, contributes to an overall picture of an individual student’s achievement.

Assessment for learning involves the use of information about student progress to support and
improve student learning, inform instructional practices, and:
   • is teacher-driven for student, teacher and parent use;
   • occurs throughout the teaching and learning process, using a variety of tools; and,
   • engages teachers in providing differentiated instruction, feedback to students to enhance their
       learning and information to parents in support of learning.

Assessment as learning actively involves student reflection on learning, monitoring of her/his own
progress, and:
   • supports students in critically analyzing learning related to curricular outcomes;
   • is student-driven with teacher guidance; and,
   • occurs throughout the learning process.

Assessment of learning involves teachers’ use of evidence of student learning to make judgements
about student achievement and:
   • provides opportunity to report evidence of achievement related to curricular outcomes;
   • occurs at the end of a learning cycle, using a variety of tools; and,
   • provides the foundation for discussions on placement or promotion.

Glossary

Cultural perspectives is the learning context that reflects a humanistic perspective which views
teaching and learning as cultural transmission and acquisition.

Scientific inquiry is the learning context that reflects an emphasis on understanding the natural
and constructed world using systematic empirical processes that lead to the formation of theories
that explain observed events and that facilitate prediction.

Scientific literacy is an evolving combination of the knowledge of nature, skills, processes and
attitudes students need to develop inquiry, problem-solving and decision-making abilities to
become lifelong learners and to maintain a sense of wonder about and responsibility towards the
natural and constructed world.

STSE decision making is the learning context that reflects the need to engage citizens in thinking
about human and world issues through a scientific lens in order to inform and empower decision
making by individuals, communities and society.

STSE, which stands for science, technology, society and the environment, is the foundation of
scientific literacy that is concerned with understanding the scope and character of science, its
connections to technology and the social context in which it is developed.

Technological problem solving is the learning context that reflects an emphasis on designing
and building to solve practical human problems.
